Python 3.7.5rc1 is now available for testing.
3.7.5rc1 is the release preview of the next maintenance release of Python 3.7,
the latest feature release of Python.
Assuming no critical problems are found prior to 2019-10-14,
no code changes are planned between now and the final release.
This release candidate is intended to give you the opportunity to test the new security and bug fixes in 3.7.5.
We strongly encourage you to test your projects and report issues found to bugs.python.org as soon as possible.
Please keep in mind that this is a preview release and, thus, its use is not recommended for production environments.
